# Recognition & Rewards

Culture change requires incentives. Recognize and reward teams that build security into their process.

---

## Tactic 1: Public Recognition & Celebration

Visible recognition drives behavior. Celebrate security wins publicly and consistently.

### Implementation Steps

1. **Monthly "Security Hero" award:**
   - Nominate via Slack form: `/security hero @person reason`
   - Winners announced in all-hands meeting
   - Feature in company newsletter
   - Small gift or bonus consideration

2. **Team-level recognition:**

   ```markdown
   ## Top Security Teams (January 2026)

   🥇 **Platform Team** - 85/100 scorecard
      - Reduced critical issues by 8
      - Achieved 100% secret rotation compliance
      - Zero credential exposure incidents

   🥈 **Backend Team** - 82/100 scorecard
      - Improved test coverage from 65% to 78%
      - Onboarded to pre-commit hooks (100% adoption)

   🥉 **Frontend Team** - 78/100 scorecard
      - Eliminated hardcoded secrets
      - Implemented CSP headers across all apps
   ```

3. **Celebrate zero-incident milestones:**
   - "API Gateway: 365 days zero security incidents 🎉"
   - Post in #general, update README badge
   - Public announcement on org blog

4. **Highlight champion achievements:**

   ```markdown
   ## Security Champion Spotlight

   **Alice Chen** (Platform Team)
   - Reduced SAST violations by 60% in 3 months
   - Mentored 4 engineers on secure coding
   - Led pre-commit hook rollout across org
   - Nominating for security bonus

   **Action**: Support Alice's nomination for Q1 bonus pool.
   ```

5. **Public learning content:**
   - Champions write blog posts on lessons learned
   - Record "Security Deep Dive" video series
   - Feature in internal podcast or newsletter
   - LinkedIn articles (with permission)

### Metrics to Track

- **Recognition Frequency**: Awards per month (target: 2-4)
- **Participation Rate**: % of team aware of recognition program (target: >80%)
- **Sentiment Analysis**: Tone of recognition posts (should be positive)
- **Retention Impact**: Do recognized engineers stay longer? (track turnover)

### Common Pitfalls

- **Generic Recognition**: "Thanks for good security" means nothing. Be specific about what they did.
- **Inconsistent Recognition**: Recognize one team, ignore others. Track and balance across org.
- **No Real Incentive**: Award with no actual benefit (bonus, time off, career impact). Make recognition meaningful.
- **Public Shaming**: Don't call out teams with poor scores. Focus on recognition, not punishment.

!!! success "Celebrate Small Wins"
    Don't wait for perfection. Celebrate teams that improve by 5 points, engineers who mentor one peer, champions who ship one security improvement. Frequent small recognitions build momentum faster than rare large ones.

### Success Criteria

- >80% of team aware of recognition program
- 2-4 public recognitions per month
- Recognized engineers report higher engagement
- Team members actively participate in nomination process

## Integration: Making Recognition Stick

Security recognition works when:

1. **Recognition is specific** - Call out exact contributions, not generic "good job"
2. **Rewards are meaningful** - Bonuses, time off, career growth, not just thank-you notes
3. **Recognition is consistent** - Monthly cadence, balanced across teams
4. **Impact is visible** - Connect recognition to scorecard improvements and team outcomes

The goal: Make security contributions visible and valued at every level.
