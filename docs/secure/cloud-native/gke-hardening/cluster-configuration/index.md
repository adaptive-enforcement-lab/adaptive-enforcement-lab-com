# GKE Cluster Configuration

Fundamental cluster security configuration covering private networking, identity federation, and image verification.

## Overview

This section covers the foundational security configurations for GKE clusters:

1. **[Private GKE Cluster](private-cluster.md)** - Private control plane, VPC networking, and encrypted etcd
2. **[Workload Identity](workload-identity.md)** - Pod-to-GCP authentication without service account keys
3. **[Binary Authorization](binary-authorization.md)** - Shielded Nodes and image verification

!!! warning "Public Cluster Risk"

    Public control planes expose your cluster API to the internet. Even with strong authentication, this increases attack surface and is not recommended for production.

## Security Principles

### Defense in Depth

- **Private Control Plane**: API server accessible only from authorized networks
- **Workload Identity**: Pods authenticate to GCP without static credentials
- **Shielded Nodes**: Secure boot, measured boot, and integrity monitoring
- **Binary Authorization**: Only verified container images run on the cluster

### Configuration Management

All configurations use Terraform for Infrastructure as Code, enabling:

- Repeatable deployments across environments
- Version-controlled security policies
- Automated compliance validation
- Drift detection and remediation

## Prerequisites

- GCP project with billing enabled
- `gcloud` CLI installed and authenticated
- Terraform 1.0+
- kubectl configured for cluster access
- Appropriate IAM permissions (Project Editor or Security Admin roles)

!!! danger "Production Warning"

    These configurations enforce strict security controls. Test in QAC/DEV before production deployment.

## Quick Start

```bash
# Initialize Terraform
terraform init

# Apply cluster configuration
terraform apply \
  -var="gcp_project=$PROJECT_ID" \
  -var="cluster_name=prod-cluster" \
  -var="environment=prd" \
  -var="team=platform" \
  -var="cost_center=engineering" \
  -var="admin_cidr_block=203.0.113.0/24"

# Get cluster credentials
gcloud container clusters get-credentials prod-cluster \
  --region us-central1 \
  --project $PROJECT_ID

# Verify private cluster
gcloud container clusters describe prod-cluster \
  --region us-central1 \
  --format="value(privateClusterConfig.enablePrivateNodes)"
```
