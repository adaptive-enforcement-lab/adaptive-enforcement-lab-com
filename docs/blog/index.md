!!! tip "Looking for Implementation Guides?"

    The documentation sections ([Enforce](../enforce/index.md), [Secure](../secure/index.md), [Patterns](../patterns/index.md)) contain step-by-step implementation guides. This blog covers the *why* behind those patterns and documents real-world lessons learned.
