# Versioned Documentation

Deploy documentation versions that align with software releases using MkDocs Material and mike.

!!! abstract "Version Alignment"
    Users need docs that match the version they're running. Integrate release-please with mike to deploy version-tagged documentation alongside software releases.

---

## Overview

Versioned documentation solves a critical problem: users need docs that match the version they're running, not the latest development state.

This pattern integrates with [release-please](../release-pipelines/release-please/index.md) to deploy version-tagged documentation alongside software releases.

    end

    subgraph Pipeline["Unified Pipeline"]

        F[Build Artifacts]
        G[Deploy Versioned Docs]
        H[Deploy Dev Docs]
    end

    subgraph Outputs["Documentation Versions"]
        I["v1.2.3 (release)"]
        J["v1 (alias)"]

## Key Concepts

### Version Aliasing

Mike manages documentation versions with aliases:

| Version | Alias | Purpose |
| --------- | ------- | --------- |
| `1.2.3` | `v1`, `latest` | Current stable release |
| `1.1.0` | | Previous releases |
| `dev` | | Continuous from main branch |

Users selecting "v1" always get the latest 1.x release. The `latest` alias points to the most recent stable version.

### Deployment Strategy

| Trigger | Action |
| --------- | -------- |
| Release created | Deploy versioned docs with aliases |
| Docs changed (no release) | Deploy to `dev` only |
| No docs changes | Skip documentation build entirely |
