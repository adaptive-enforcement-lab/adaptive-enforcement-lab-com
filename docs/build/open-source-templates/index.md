# Open Source Project Templates

Copy-paste templates for open source project documentation based on real OpenSSF Best Practices Badge certification work. CONTRIBUTING.md, SECURITY.md, and GitHub issue forms with realistic SLAs and proven compliance.

!!! tip "Source Material"
    These templates come from the [readability project's OpenSSF certification](https://github.com/adaptive-enforcement-lab/readability) (PRs [#93](https://github.com/adaptive-enforcement-lab/readability/pull/93), [#94](https://github.com/adaptive-enforcement-lab/readability/pull/94), [#95](https://github.com/adaptive-enforcement-lab/readability/pull/95)).

## Why These Templates Matter

OpenSSF Best Practices Badge certification revealed the pattern: most projects have solid technical infrastructure but lack **documentation**.

The badge criteria require:

- ✅ CONTRIBUTING.md with development setup and testing requirements
- ✅ SECURITY.md with disclosure process and response timelines
- ✅ Issue templates for bug reports and feature requests
- ✅ Clear communication of contribution guidelines

These are the main gap for well-maintained projects. Templates fill the gap.

## Template Library

### CONTRIBUTING.md Template

The [CONTRIBUTING.md template](contributing-template.md) provides:

- Annotated template with placeholders for project-specific details
- Real example from production (readability project)
- Development setup, code style, testing requirements
- Pull request process and commit message conventions
- Code review requirements

[View CONTRIBUTING Template →](contributing-template.md)

---

### SECURITY.md Template

The [SECURITY.md template](security-template.md) provides:

- Template with realistic SLAs and private disclosure mechanisms
- Real example from production (readability project)
- Supported versions table
- Reporting process (GitHub Security Advisories + email)
- Response timelines by severity level
- Security measures documentation

[View SECURITY Template →](security-template.md)

---

### GitHub Issue Templates

The [GitHub issue templates](issue-templates.md) provide:

- Bug report YAML form template
- Feature request YAML form template
- Template configuration (config.yml)
- Structured fields with validation

## OpenSSF Best Practices Alignment

How these templates satisfy OpenSSF Badge criteria:

| Criterion | Template | Compliance |
|-----------|----------|------------|
| **Documentation** | CONTRIBUTING.md | ✅ Explains how to contribute |
| **Bug Reporting** | Bug Report template | ✅ Structured process |
| **Enhancement Proposals** | Feature Request template | ✅ Clear submission path |
| **Security Process** | SECURITY.md | ✅ Disclosure mechanism |
| **Response Timelines** | SECURITY.md SLAs | ✅ Realistic commitments |
| **Testing Requirements** | CONTRIBUTING.md | ✅ Coverage thresholds |
| **Code Review** | CONTRIBUTING.md PR process | ✅ Approval requirements |

### Badge Checklist Mapping

✅ **Contributing file**: CONTRIBUTING.md with setup, testing, PR process

✅ **Bug reporting**: Issue templates with structured fields

✅ **Enhancement proposals**: Feature request template

✅ **Security disclosure**: SECURITY.md with private channel (Security Advisories)

✅ **Security response**: Documented SLAs (48hr initial, 7 day update, 90 day resolution)

## Common Gaps These Templates Fill

### 1. Missing Security Disclosure Process

**Problem**: No SECURITY.md, reporters open public issues with vulnerability details.

**Fix**: SECURITY.md with GitHub Security Advisories link + email fallback.

### 2. Unrealistic SLAs

**Problem**: SECURITY.md promises "immediate response" that never happens.

**Fix**: Realistic timelines (48 hours, not "immediately"). Better to under-promise and over-deliver.

### 3. Unstructured Bug Reports

**Problem**: Issues say "it doesn't work" with zero details.

**Fix**: YAML issue templates with required fields for reproduction steps, environment, logs.

### 4. No Testing Requirements

**Problem**: PRs without tests get merged, coverage drops.

**Fix**: CONTRIBUTING.md explicitly states coverage threshold and test commands.

### 5. No Development Setup

**Problem**: Contributors can't set up project locally.

**Fix**: CONTRIBUTING.md with prerequisite list and installation commands.

## Customization Checklist

When adapting these templates:

- [ ] Replace `[PROJECT_NAME]` with actual project name
- [ ] Replace `[ORG]` with GitHub organization
- [ ] Replace `[LANGUAGE]`, `[VERSION]` with tech stack
- [ ] Update install commands (`npm install`, `pip install`, `go mod download`)
- [ ] Update test commands (`npm test`, `pytest`, `go test`)
- [ ] Update linter/formatter names (`eslint`, `black`, `golangci-lint`)
- [ ] Set realistic SLA timelines based on team capacity
- [ ] Update supported versions table in SECURITY.md
- [ ] Configure issue template labels to match your project
- [ ] Update security measures list (SBOM, scanning tools, etc.)
