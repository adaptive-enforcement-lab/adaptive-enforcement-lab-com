# Idempotency

Build automation that survives reruns.

Workflows fail. Networks timeout. APIs return 500s. Rate limits hit. Runners crash. When failure happens, idempotent operations let you click "rerun" and walk away.

!!! abstract "Definition"

    An operation is idempotent if running it multiple times produces the same result as running it once.

---

## Why It Matters

When your workflow fails at step 47 of 50, you have three options:

1. **Rerun from beginning** - Only safe if workflow is idempotent
2. **Manual intervention** - Fix state by hand, then continue
3. **Abandon and start fresh** - Delete partial state, try again later

!!! success "The Scalable Choice"

    Safe reruns are the only scalable choice. Manual intervention and abandoning runs require human effort, don't scale, and introduce errors.

## Quick Reference

```bash
# Idempotent: Running twice produces same result
mkdir -p /tmp/mydir    # Creates dir if missing, no-op if exists

# Not idempotent: Running twice fails or creates duplicates
mkdir /tmp/mydir       # Fails if directory exists
```

For CI/CD pipelines, idempotency means:

- Reruns don't create duplicate PRs
- Reruns don't create duplicate commits
- Reruns don't corrupt data
- Partial failures can be recovered by rerunning
