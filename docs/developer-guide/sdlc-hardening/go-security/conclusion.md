The complete Go security toolkit costs nothing. Standard tools integrate seamlessly and run automatically.

!!! tip "Start Today"
    Install golangci-lint, add pre-commit hooks, configure CI. You'll have production-grade security in one afternoon.

## Cost

**Total cost**: $0

All tools are open source and free. No SaaS subscriptions, no enterprise licenses, no vendor lock-in.

## Why This Works

1. **Zero friction**: Standard tools integrate with `go test`, `go build`, IDE
2. **Always running**: Pre-commit hooks catch issues before commit
3. **CI enforcement**: Blocks merge if security checks fail
4. **No maintenance**: Tools maintained by Go community and major security vendors
5. **Certification ready**: Meets OpenSSF and audit requirements

Exotic security tools gather dust. Standard tools run on every commit.
