# Kyverno Generation Templates

Kyverno generation policies automatically create supporting resources when specific conditions are met. Instead of relying on manual configuration or documentation, generation policies enforce security and resilience by default.

!!! warning "Manual Configuration Creates Gaps"
    Relying on documentation to ensure every namespace has ResourceQuotas or every HA workload has a PodDisruptionBudget creates inconsistencies. Generation policies enforce these requirements automatically at creation time.

## What is Generation?

Generation policies create new Kubernetes resources in response to triggers. When a namespace is created, a generation policy can automatically add ResourceQuotas, NetworkPolicies, and LimitRanges. When a high-availability Deployment appears, a generation policy can create a PodDisruptionBudget.

This eliminates the gap between "we should have this" and "we do have this."

---

## Key Concepts

### Triggers

Generation policies react to resource creation or changes:

- **Namespace creation** → Generate default-deny NetworkPolicies and ResourceQuotas
- **Deployment with 2+ replicas** → Generate PodDisruptionBudget
- **Production workload** → Generate stricter quotas and policies
- **Label changes** → Synchronize generated resources with new requirements

### Synchronization

When `synchronize: true` is set, Kyverno keeps generated resources in sync with the source. If you change a namespace label, the generated ResourceQuota updates to match. If you scale a Deployment to 1 replica, the PodDisruptionBudget is removed.

This enforces consistency without manual intervention.

### Exclusions and Preconditions

Generation policies use exclusions to skip system namespaces and preconditions to enforce requirements:

```yaml
exclude:
  resources:
    names:
      - kube-system
      - kube-public
      - kube-node-lease

preconditions:
  all:
    - key: "{{ request.object.spec.replicas }}"
      operator: GreaterThanOrEquals
      value: 2
```

Only workloads meeting specific criteria get generated resources.

## Template Categories

### Namespace Resources

Automatically create security and resource governance for new namespaces:

- **[ResourceQuotas and NetworkPolicies](namespace.md)** - Default quotas and default-deny networking for every new namespace

**Use cases:**

- Prevent resource exhaustion from unconstrained namespaces
- Enforce zero-trust networking by default
- Automatically apply environment-specific quotas (dev vs production)
- Ensure DNS egress is allowed while blocking other traffic

---

### Workload Resources

Automatically create resilience and availability controls for high-availability workloads:

- **[PodDisruptionBudgets](workload.md)** - Automatic PDBs for Deployments and StatefulSets with multiple replicas

**Use cases:**

- Prevent downtime during cluster upgrades and node maintenance
- Enforce SLA compliance for critical services
- Protect against mass pod evictions during autoscaling
- Maintain service availability during partial failures

---

## When to Use Generation

**Use generation when:**

- You want to enforce security-by-default for all new resources
- Manual configuration creates gaps and inconsistencies
- You need automatic synchronization with changing requirements
- Supporting resources should follow workload lifecycle (create, update, delete)

**Do not use generation when:**

- Resources require unique, per-workload customization
- Generated resources would conflict with existing resources
- You need human approval before resource creation
- The triggering resource does not contain enough context to generate correctly

---

## Validation Strategy

After deploying generation policies, validate that resources are created correctly:

```bash
# Check that new namespaces get ResourceQuotas
kubectl create namespace test-gen
kubectl get resourcequotas -n test-gen

# Check that multi-replica Deployments get PDBs
kubectl create deployment nginx --image=nginx --replicas=3 -n test-gen
kubectl label deployment nginx app=nginx -n test-gen
kubectl get pdb -n test-gen

# Audit resources without expected generated objects
kubectl get namespaces -o json | jq -r '.items[] | select(.metadata.name != "kube-system") | .metadata.name' | while read ns; do
  quota_count=$(kubectl get resourcequotas -n $ns --no-headers 2>/dev/null | wc -l)
  if [ $quota_count -eq 0 ]; then
    echo "WARNING: Namespace $ns has no ResourceQuota"
  fi
done
```
